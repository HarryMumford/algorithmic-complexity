# Task

Reverse order of elements in array

## I => O

```
[1] => [1]
[1, 2] => [2, 1]
[1, 2, 3] => [3, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 3, 4] => [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### Real life approach
Assuming elements in array are pieces of paper arranged in a line from left to right

1. Swap leftmost piece with rightmost piece
2. Swap second leftmost piece with rightmost piece
3. Repeat until all pieces are swapped

or 

1. Move the piece on the right to a new line
2. Move the piece on the right of the old line to the right of the piece on the new line
3. Continue until all pieces on the old line are in the new one
